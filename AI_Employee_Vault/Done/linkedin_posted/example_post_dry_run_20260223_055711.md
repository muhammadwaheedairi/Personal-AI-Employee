🚀 Excited to share what we've been building this week!

We've been working on an autonomous AI Employee that handles email triage, client communications, and business reporting — all running locally with full privacy.

Key highlights:
✅ 24/7 monitoring of Gmail and WhatsApp
✅ Human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive actions
✅ Auto-generated Monday morning CEO briefings
✅ Zero data sent to third parties

The future of work isn't replacing humans — it's giving every founder a team that never sleeps.
