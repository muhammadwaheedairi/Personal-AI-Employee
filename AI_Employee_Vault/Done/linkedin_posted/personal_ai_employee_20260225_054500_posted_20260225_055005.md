We built an AI Employee that monitors Gmail and WhatsApp 24/7. Here's what it does.

It watches for urgent messages, triages them by intent, drafts professional replies, and waits for human approval before sending. Everything flows through an Obsidian vault — no black boxes, full transparency.

The workflow: Watcher detects urgent keyword → Creates action file → AI drafts reply → Human approves → Message sent → Everything logged.

This morning it handled 2 urgent WhatsApp messages about a payment discussion, drafted a reply, and sent it after my approval. Total time: 2 minutes instead of 20.

The best part? All local. No data leaves the machine. Full control, zero vendor lock-in.

What's the first communication task you'd hand off to an AI employee?
