We built an autonomous AI Employee in a hackathon weekend.

It watches my Gmail, WhatsApp, and LinkedIn — triages messages, drafts replies, generates invoices, and even writes LinkedIn posts (like this one). Everything flows through an Obsidian vault with human-in-the-loop approval for sensitive actions.

The architecture: Python watchers + Claude MCP + markdown-based task routing. No external APIs storing my data. Everything runs locally.

Best part? It generates a Monday morning CEO briefing by auditing what got done, what's pending, and where bottlenecks are.

What's the first business task you'd hand off to an AI employee?
