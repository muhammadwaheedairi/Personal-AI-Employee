Hi Waheed,

I'd be happy to send the invoice right away. To ensure I send you the correct invoice, could you please confirm:

1. Which project this is for?
2. The agreed amount
3. Any specific invoice details or reference numbers you need

Once I have these details, I'll generate and send the invoice immediately.

Best regards,

*Sent with AI assistance*
