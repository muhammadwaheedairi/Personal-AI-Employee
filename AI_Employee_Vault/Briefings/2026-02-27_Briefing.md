## Bottlenecks
None identified — all plans completed and archived.

## Revenue & Goals
- **Monthly goal:** $2,000
- **Invoiced MTD:** $5,800 (290% of target)
- **Collected MTD:** $0 (0% of target)
- **Trend:** ⚠️ **Revenue at risk** — invoices issued but no payments received yet

**Gap Analysis:** While invoicing exceeds target by 190%, zero cash collection creates immediate concern. All three invoices were issued within the last 24 hours.

## Proactive Suggestions

1. **Payment Follow-up:** All invoices are less than 24 hours old. [ACTION] Set up 3-day and 7-day payment reminder automation?

2. **Cash Flow Monitoring:** With $5,800 outstanding and only $20/month in expenses, business is operationally healthy but needs payment collection process. [ACTION] Implement payment tracking in weekly briefings?

3. **Social Media Momentum:** 8 posts published today announcing first AI Employee deployment. [ACTION] Monitor engagement metrics and schedule follow-up content for next week?

4. **KPI Performance:**
   - Emails processed: 6 (target: 20/week) — 30% of target
   - WhatsApp responses: 8 (target: 10/week) — 80% of target ✓
   - LinkedIn posts: 1 (target: 3/week) — 33% of target
   - Twitter posts: 4 (target: 5/week) — 80% of target ✓

## Upcoming Deadlines (next 14 days)
- **2026-03-01:** Personal AI Employee project deadline ($500 value)
- **2026-03-15:** Client Automation Setup deadline ($800 value)

## System Health
- ✅ All watchers operational (Gmail, WhatsApp, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram)
- ✅ Odoo integration functional (3 invoices created successfully)
- ✅ MCP servers active (WhatsApp, Email, Social Media, Odoo)
- ✅ Zero pending actions in vault
